# DBT Notes

## `env_var` what is environment variables in DBT

The `env_var` function can be used to incorporate Environment Variables from the system into your dbt project. 

1. `env_var` function can be used in your `profiles.yml` file, the `dbt_project.yml` file, the `sources.yml` file, your `schema.yml` files, and in `model .sql` files. Essentially `env_var` is available anywhere dbt processes jinja code.
2. use jinja to reference the environment variables `"{{ env_var('DBT_USER') }}"`, `'{{ env_var('DBT_USER') }}'`
3. if value type is required, e.g. int, use jinja filter to cast data type `"{{ env_var('DBT_USER') | int }}"`
4. pass `env_var` default value: `"{{ env_var('DBT_MATERIALIZATION', 'view') }}"`

## special environment variables in DBT 

Secret 

1. prefix with `DBT_ENV_SECRET_`
2. reference value with `{{ env_var('DBT_ENV_SECRET_xxx) }}`
3. key features of secret env variable in dbt 
    - allowed only in `profiles.yml` `packages.yml`
    - disallowed in `dbt_projects.yml`, model sql to avoid ingest secret values to data warehouse
    - log output of secret is replace with `*****`


Custom Metadata

1. prefix with `DBT_ENV_CUSTOM_ENV_`
2. reference values with `{{ dbt_metadata_envs }}`
3. examples

```
$ DBT_ENV_CUSTOM_ENV_MY_FAVORITE_COLOR=indigo DBT_ENV_CUSTOM_ENV_MY_FAVORITE_NUMBER=6 dbt compile

-- {{ dbt_metadata_envs }}
-- {'MY_FAVORITE_COLOR': 'indigo', 'DBT_ENV_CUSTOM_ENV_MY_FAVORITE_NUMBER': '6'}
```


## dbt environment variables must start with `DBT_` prefix?

yes

## `var` what is Variables in DBT

dbt provides a mechanism, variables, to provide data to models for compilation. 
Variables can be used to configure `timezones,` avoid `hardcoding table names` or otherwise provide data to models to configure how they are compiled.

`Variables` can be passed from your `dbt_project.yml` file into models during compilation.

1. define variables in `dbt_project.yml`
2. reference var with `{{ var('var_name') }}` in models 
3. default value: The `var("event_type", "activation")` function takes an optional second argument as default
4. examples 

```
# dbt_project.yml
name: my_dbt_project
version: 1.0.0
vars:
  event_type: activation

-- use variable defined in dbt_project.yml
select * from events where event_type = '{{ var("event_type", "xxx") }}'ÃŸ
```

docs: https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/dbt-jinja-functions/var


## Variables precedence 

where variables can be defined 

1. command line option `--vars json_str`
2. in `dbt_project.yml`, `vars` block 
3. package's `dbt_project.yml`, `vars` block
4. default value, 2nd argument of `var` function


The order of precedence for variable declaration is as follows (highest priority first):

1. The variables defined on the command line with --vars.
2. The package-scoped variable declaration in the `root dbt_project.yml` file
3. The global variable declaration in the `root dbt_project.yml` file
4. If this node is defined in a package: variable declarations in that package's dbt_project.yml file
5. The variable's default argument (if one is provided)


## DBT "+" prefix 

1. "+" prefix in  `dbt_profile.yml` to differentiate path resources VS config (with the same name)
2. "+" prefix for node selection during CLI `--select +xxxx` select node xxxx and its upstream


example: `+tags` is config, while `tags` without "+" is resource path 

```
name: jaffle_shop
config-version: 2

...

models:
  +persist_docs: # this config is a dictionary, so needs a + prefix
    relation: true
    columns: true

  jaffle_shop:
    schema: my_schema # a plus prefix is optional here
    +tags: # this is the tag config
      - "hello"
    tags: # whereas this is the tag resource path
      # The below config applies to models in the
      # models/tags/ directory.
      # Note: you don't _need_ a leading + here,
      # but it wouldn't hurt.
      materialized: view

```

## what is DBT Hook 

Effective database administration sometimes requires additional SQL statements to be run, for example:

- Creating UDFs
- Managing row- or column-level permissions
- Vacuuming tables on Redshift
- Creating partitions in Redshift Spectrum external tables
- Resuming/pausing/resizing warehouses in Snowflake

dbt provides hooks and operations so you can version control (static) and execute (runtime) these statements as part of your dbt project.


Hooks are snippets of SQL that are executed at different times:

- pre-hook: executed before a model, seed or snapshot is built.
- post-hook: executed after a model, seed or snapshot is built.
- on-run-start: executed at the start of dbt build, dbt compile, dbt docs generate, dbt run, dbt seed, dbt snapshot, or dbt test.
- on-run-end: executed at the end of dbt build, dbt compile, dbt docs generate, dbt run, dbt seed, dbt snapshot, or dbt test.

pre-hook / post-hook are model related 

on-run-start/ on-run-end are related to cli command execution


## DBT Hooks execution order 

- Hooks are cumulative: If you define hooks in both your dbt_project.yml and in the config block of a model, both sets of hooks will be applied to your model.

- Execution ordering: If multiple instances of any hooks are defined, dbt will run each hook using the following ordering:

  + Hooks from dependent packages will be run before hooks in the active package.
  + Hooks defined within the model itself will be run after hooks defined in dbt_project.yml.
  + Hooks within a given context will be run in the order in which they are defined.

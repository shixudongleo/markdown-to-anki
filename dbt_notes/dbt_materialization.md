# DBT Materialization

## What are the five materialization in DBT

1. view (default)
2. table 
3. ephemeral 
4. incremental 
5. snapshot


## how does view and table materialization work in DBT

`create or replace view xxx as ()`

`create or replace table xxx as ()`


## how does ephemeral how does view and table 

- don't exist in database 
- repeated snippet as CTE and used by calling ref to the ephemeral model

cavete:

- `select * from ephemeral_model` will have database error, as it doesn't exists in the DB


## Tradeoff of view / table / ephemeral 

- speedï¼šephermal (fast) / view (intermediate) / table (take the longer time)
- storage: ephermal (no data stored) / view (no data stored) / table (rebuild data every time)
- compute: ephermal (similar to view) / view (recalculate every time) / table(use table's persisted result)

## what is the incremental model in DBT

if history data doesn't change, and the transformation done on historical data shouldn't be done over and over again. (e.g log data, di/hi tables)
benefits: you save time and money

## How to make incremental model in DBT

- `materialized='incremental'`
- how to identify new rows?
    - event time > max(event time) of existing table
    - run the filter only when incremental runs `{% if is_incremental() %}`
    - `{{ this }}` refer to the model itself

## Tips on DBT Materialization 

1. starts with view; when it takes too long, change to table; when it takes too long to build, switch to incremental.
